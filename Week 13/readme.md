FINAL PROJECT PROPOSAL; ORBITAL COLLISION
	I will be creating a visualizer that shows planetary orbits around the sun, however, each of the 8 planets will have their own characteristics, represented by faces, that accurately portray each planet. I will have them each on an independent orbit pathway, similar to reality, with motion in all of the faces as they rotate around the “sun”. I will use collision and button/mouse clicks mainly in order to pull the orbits of each planet closer together. As they start to collide, the planets will explode and their features (faces) will begin to move aimlessly around the screen. As the last planet explodes, another mouse click will be used to begin to force all the aimless shapes to converge into one orbit around the sun, similar to an asteroid belt. My goal with this is to represent the melting pot of cultures and how, even in the face of failure or destruction, even elements at their simplest form will find a way to return to unity. 
I am of course pulling inspiration from our solar system, but also the past animated character self portrait assignment we did, as I thought that was one of my more successful projects this semester. As for outside artistic influences, I didn't pinpoint one specific artist but rather the retrofuturism movement, as I think the saturated colors and character design are always super intriguing. 
Deadlines:
	April 24th - plan project, sketch design, write proposal
	April 26th - begin work, make orbit pattern and basic shapes
	April 29th - proposal due
	April 30th - code facial features on objects
	May 2nd - code background, star patterns, and other embellishments 
	May 3rd - code movement and button clicks, set up collisions, etc.
	May 5th - final checks/adjustments, submit
This week I have already been focusing on the movement patterns and basic shape configuration, as well as what I might want the background to look like. The only main concern I have is getting all the various shapes and facial features to stay organized as they orbit...I am going to have to be VERY specific with my code and organiziation.
