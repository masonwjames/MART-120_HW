I would say that yes, the quiz results are representative of how I like to learn. It said that I am an auditory learner and as such, I find myself thriving in an environment where information is relayed through sound such as lectures or videos. I can't just engage with materials or read it. I need to be told and reinforced. I think auditory learning resonates with me because it aligns with my natural inclination towards verbal communication. I have always loved a conversation or any type of storytelling. Ever since I have been great at understanding nuances of speech, tone, and many other verbal cues. Audio creates an immediate response and forces you to make a choice about the whatever you are listening to.
