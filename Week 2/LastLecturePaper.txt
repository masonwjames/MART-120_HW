Randy Pausch’s Last Lecture has had a great impact on me, allowing me to reevaluate my own approach to the challenges that life brings. His optimism when faced with a terminal diagnosis ignited something in me, giving me a little hope for an otherwise difficult week in my life adjusting to school. 
What resonated the most for me was his positivity and pure resilience even in the harshest of circumstances. 
He has inspired me to adopt a similar level of determination to overcome. 
As I watched I felt compelled to love life and view challenges as not impossible and more so as opportunities rather than hurdles. 
His own story, achieving professional success despite numerous setbacks, gives a reminder of the power of being resilient, in particular with his analogy of “brick walls” we encounter in life. 
This lecture serves as a catalyst allowing one to examine their own priorities and the way we overcome challenges. 
His word gave me slightly more hope for myself this semester and through his inspiration, I am reminded of the power of the human spirit and the potential in all of us for greatness.
