In the context of our course, GitHub has both a web-based GUI, as well as a CLI tool/ The GUI is an organized, user-friendly catalog for managing your repositories, as well as many other items. 
It shows functions visually, allowing the user to interact with repositories through clicks instead of commands. 
This type of interface is, in my opinion, a lot better for newbies, but can be very resource intensive and require powerful firmware in order to run as efficiently as possible. 
The CLI allows a user to do many of the same actions, just using only text commands instead. 
This is significantly more efficient , especially for experienced coders who are comfortable with the command line. 
CLIâ€™s are often favored by system administrators and developers for their speed and ability to handle complex issues.
They have a steeper learning and I personally am a little intimidated by them, but their ability to automate tasks is very attractive. 
The choice is ultimately up to the user, but I think that any type of interface that makes you feel organized and not inconvenienced is the one you should use.
